# What it does

For now it shows all the text-based clients connected to the horde and shows most of the information contained in the API. I left out some stuff that i thought was useless. I'll probalbly add more things and change some stuff, like showing the kudos better or colorizing all the properties, that's for 1.0.

image-based workers are coming soon. I need to refactor some stuff before i can do it.

# Why i made this
I was messing around with kobold AI and I wanted to share my GPU with the horde, I wanted to see if the changes I made in the UI were updating for everyone else.
I got tired of staring at plain json from the [API URL](https://aihorde.net/api/v2/workers?type=text), so i started making a small app, then I went a little overboard with the UI...

## More stuff

This app was coded to [Dief](https://open.spotify.com/album/0oZiDBfoqJTgIcPdCfVGSQ) by C418, you should check it out if you like chill music!
